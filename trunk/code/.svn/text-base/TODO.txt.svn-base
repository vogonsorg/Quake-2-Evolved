Renderer
==================================================
Cleanups
- Rewrite parts of RB_BatchParticle

Features
- Subviews
- Make sure the debug tools are working as they should with GL_DepthBounds etc.
- Internal Default Model
- rg.pc.dynamicDecal needs to be set
- Make some kind of debugging tool the shows culling, because right now we only have a counter that isnt that great
  but it would be better with a visual tool. Similar to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPRuRonvlw4.
  - RB_ShowCull
- Generate vertex/index buffer cache for BSP and Alias models

Fixes
- Stencil Shadows are flickering
  - 1.) Vertex buffer problem?
  - 2.) It some how "works" with light scissors
- Blend, fog, and ambient lights have a "black square" problem.
  - 1.) Looks like it's a face culling problem
- Light scissors are not working
  - GL_Scissor problem?
  - backEnd.scissor or backEnd.viewport issue?
- noDraw has no texture
- R_UniformMatrix3 has a warning C4047: 'function' : 'const float *' differs in levels of indirection from 'vec3_t [3]'
- Beams are culled out wrong
- Mem_ClearedAlloc to Mem_Alloc problem(s)
  1.) Invalid nodes in R_MarkLeaves
- When selecting lights in the light editor, it draws the center from the last selected light

Optimizations
- The renderer must be 60FPS stable before release
  - The lights are the ones who takes away most of the frame rate
    1.) Culling
	2.) Precaching
	3.) One pass for both static and dynamic lights
	4.) Compute data when needed

Cleanups
- Re-order pointers in SG_SetupFramework

Features
