/*
 ==============================================================================

 Memory Manager:

 Dynamic memory may be allocated from one of three internal zones or directly
 from the heap.

 The memory manager will select the appropriate allocator depending on the
 requested size.

 None of the functions that allocate memory will ever return a NULL pointer.

 If an internal zone can't satisfy an allocation request (due to lack of free
 space or excessive fragmentation), memory will be allocated from the heap.
 In case the heap is also unable to allocate memory, the program will terminate
 immediately with an error message.

 All memory allocations are tagged to allow the memory manager to free all the
 memory blocks with the same tag through a single function call.

 Freeing a pointer may not actually release the memory. If it was allocated
 from one of the internal zones, the block will just be marked as reusable for
 any future allocations and possibly merged with contiguous free blocks to
 reduce fragmentation.

 Temporary allocations should only be used for file loading and any other
 operations that are temporary in nature.

 Memory blocks that are meant to be used for permanent or long-term storage
 should never be tagged as temporary because they will be freed automatically
 after loading a level or recovering from a non-fatal error.

 Temporary memory is always allocated from the heap to avoid fragmenting the
 internal zones during level loading.

 All memory allocations are always guaranteed to be 8-byte aligned unless
 16-byte alignment is explicitly requested.
