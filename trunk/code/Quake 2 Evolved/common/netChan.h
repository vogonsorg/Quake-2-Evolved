 Network Channels:

 TODO

 Packet header:
 --------------
 31	sequence
 1		Does this message contain a reliable payload
 31		Acknowledge sequence
 1		Acknowledge receipt of even/odd message
 16		qport

 The remote connection never knows if it missed a reliable message, the
 local side detects that it has been dropped by seeing a sequence
 acknowledge higher than the last reliable sequence, but without the
 correct even/odd bit for the reliable set.

 If the sender notices that a reliable message has been dropped, it will
 be retransmitted. It will not be retransmitted again until a message
 after the retransmit has been acknowledged and the reliable still
 failed to get there.

 If the sequence number is -1, the packet should be handled without a
 net connection.

 The reliable message can be added to at any time by doing
 MSG_Write* (&netChan->message, <data>).

 If the message buffer is overflowed, either by a single message, or by
 multiple frames worth piling up while the last reliable transmit goes
 unacknowledged, the netChan signals a fatal error.

 Reliable messages are always placed first in a packet, then the
 unreliable message is included if there is sufficient room.

 To the receiver, there is no distinction between the reliable and
 unreliable parts of the message, they are just processed out as a
 single larger message.

 Illogical packet sequence numbers cause the packet to be dropped, but
 do not kill the connection. This, combined with the tight window of
 valid reliable acknowledgement numbers provides protection against
 malicious address spoofing.

 The qport field is a workaround for bad address translating routers
 that sometimes remap the client's source port on a packet during
 gameplay.

 If the base part of the net address matches and the qport matches, then
 the channel matches even if the IP port differs. The IP port should be
 updated to the new value before sending out any replies.

 If there is no information that needs to be transfered on a given
 frame, such as during the connection stage while waiting for the client
 to load, then a packet only needs to be delivered if there is something
 in the unacknowledged reliable.
